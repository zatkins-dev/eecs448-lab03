            <h2>The Man Behind the Hood</h2>
            <p> 
                Some call him a tyrant. Others, a monster. Yet others, a teacher. Yet all who know him share one view: Sheev Palpatine is an extraordinary man, the likes of whom the universe is unlikely to see again.

                In his youth, Palpatine was taken on as an apprentice, under the name Darth Sidious, to the Sith Lord Darth Plagueis. Plagious,  sensing his immense potential in the Force, was eager to train the Sidious. His training was extensive &mdash; Plagueis taught him the intricacies of all seven forms of lightsaber combat in addition to powerful Force abilities, including Force lightning, foresight, various forms of illusion, and telekinesis.

                Soon, Palpatine grew to have political ambitions. Spurred forward by Darth Plagueis, he entered politics and soon became the representative of his home planet, Naboo, in the galactic senate. Once certain that the fulfillment of his ambitions was imminent, he killed his master while he slept, claiming for himself the title of Sith Lord Darth Sidious.
